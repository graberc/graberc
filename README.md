- 🤖 **AI Product Strategy** – Building LLM-powered tools that solve real business problems
- 📈 **Creator Economy** – Monetization platforms that drive sustainable growth
- 🏥 **Healthcare Innovation** – Digital tools that improve member experiences
- 💡 **0→1 Products** – Taking ideas from concept to profitable reality
